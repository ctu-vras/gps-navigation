Newer models can be downloaded either directly from https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/geographiclib/magnetic-distrib/<MODEL_NAME>.tar.bz2?use_mirror=autoselect, or using tool `geographiclib-get-magnetic` from package `geographiclib-tools`.

The validity of the WMM models is usually 5 years.
