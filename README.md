## What is this
This used to be a repository for a multitude of different ROS packages and programs used in the RobInGas project (2022). The original contents have been split into three repositories:
  - **compass** - compass related stuff,
  - **gnss-drivers** - gps related stuff,
  - **gps-navigation** - the rest.

## Contents
 **kmz_to_waypoints** - An interactive Python tool for generating a list of waypoints from a KMZ or KML file. 
 
 **odom_fix_matching** - A Python program used for matching of odometry and fix data. 
 
 **osm_path_planner** - A ROS package containing a path planner node, visualisation tools, OSM data processing tools and joystick waypoint switching.
